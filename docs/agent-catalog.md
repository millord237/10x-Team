## Adding Custom Agents

To create a custom marketing agent:

1. Create a new file in `.claude/agents/`
2. Use the standard frontmatter format:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: agent-name
   description: When to use this agent
   model: sonnet  # or haiku, opus
   ---
   ```
3. Define the agent's role, responsibilities, and output format
4. Document in this catalog
